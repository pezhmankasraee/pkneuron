    You can also use the `makefile` as follows:
    ```bash
    $ make build
    ```
    the binary will be created at `bin/`
    
    Or, to install  directly into your  (or ):
    bash

## üí° Usage

PKNeuron is designed to be intuitive. Here's how you can get started:

### Basic Prompting

To send a prompt to the default configured LLM:

bash
pkneuron "Tell me a short story about a brave knight and a wise dragon."


### Specifying Models (Coming soon)

PKNeuron will likely support specifying different models or providers via flags or configuration:

bash
pkneuron --model openai-gpt4 "Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number."
pkneuron --provider anthropic "Summarize the key findings of the latest IPCC report."


### Getting Help

To see all available commands and options:

bash
pkneuron --help


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

PKNeuron typically uses environment variables for sensitive information like API keys. Ensure you have the necessary keys set up for the LLM providers you intend to use.

For example, for OpenAI:

bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"


Refer to the official documentation for specific LLM providers for details on obtaining API keys.
